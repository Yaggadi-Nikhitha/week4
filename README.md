# 🔢 Number Pattern Puzzle (Python)

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this mini-game is to test your pattern recognition skills. You'll be given 3 random number sequences and must guess the next number in each one.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program randomly selects 3 out of 5 predefined number patterns.
- Each pattern follows a clear mathematical rule (e.g., `+2`, `*2`, `/3`, squares, or `-2`).
- You will be prompted to guess the next number in each sequence.
- Your score out of 3 will be displayed at the end.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module
